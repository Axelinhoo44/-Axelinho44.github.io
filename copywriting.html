       <p>Web copywriting is the ability,or rather the art,of writing content that is persuasive towards the audience and that leads to a conversion.
         In the past, the copywriter was a figure present in every journalistic editorial office, who was in charge of writing announcements and advertisements. Over time this professional has become more and more specialized.
       Today copy is a key element of digital marketing and carries out activities related to the numerous aspects of online content, such as attracting a potential customer or persuading him through an engaging text that ends with a call to action.</p>
